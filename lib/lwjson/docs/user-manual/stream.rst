Stream parser
=============

Streaming parser implementation is alternative option versus standard tokenized one, in the sense that:

* There is no need to have full JSON available at one time to have successful parsing
* It can be utilized to parse very large JSON strings on very small systems with limited memory
* It allows users to *take* from the stream only necessary parts and store them to local more system-friendly variable

This type of parser does not utilize use of tokens, rather focuses on the callback function,
where user is in charge to manually understand token structure and get useful data from it.

Stream parser introduces *stack* mechanism instead - to keep the track of depthness during parsing the process.
``3`` different element types are stored on *local stack*:

* Start of object, with ``{`` character
* Start of array, with ``[`` character
* Key from the *object* entry

.. note::
    Stack is nested as long as JSON input stream is nested in the same way

Consider this input string: ``{"k1":"v1","k2":[true, false]}``.
During parsing procedure, at some point of time, these events will occur:

#. Start of *object* detected - *object* pushed to stack

    #. *key* element with name ``k1`` detected and pushed to stack

        #. *string* ``v1`` parsed as *string-value*
    #. *key* element with name ``k1`` popped from stack
    #. *key* element with name ``k2`` detected and pushed to stack

        #. Start of *array* detected - *array* pushed to stack

            #. ``true`` primitive detected
            #. ``false`` primitive detected
        #. End of *array* detected - *array* popped from stack
    #. *key* element with name ``k2`` popped from stack
#. End of *object* detected - *object* popped from stack

Each of these events is reported to user in the callback function.

An example of the stream parsing:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/example_stream.c
    :language: c
    :linenos:

Example
*******

For the purpose of example, the following JSON input...

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/stream.json
    :language: json
    :linenos:
    :caption: JSON input for streaming

\... will output the log as:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/stream_log.txt
    :linenos:
    :caption: JSON development log for the various events
